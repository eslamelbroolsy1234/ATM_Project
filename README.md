# ATM System in C++

This project is a simulation of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) system using C++. The system allows users to log in using an account number and PIN code, then perform various banking transactions, including:

- **Quick Withdraw**: Withdraw predefined amounts instantly.  
- **Normal Withdraw**: Enter a custom amount to withdraw.  
- **Deposit**: Add funds to the account.  
- **Check Balance**: View the current account balance.  
- **Logout**: Exit the system and return to the login screen.  

### Features:
- Stores client data in an external text file.  
- Validates login credentials before granting access.  
- Ensures withdrawal amounts do not exceed the available balance.  
- Text-based menu system for user interaction.  

### How to Use:
1. Run the program to display the login screen.  
2. Enter a valid account number and PIN to access the main menu.  
3. Select a transaction from the menu.  
4. After completing a transaction, you can return to the main menu or log out.  

This project provides a practical demonstration of file handling in C++ and how to manage simple financial transactions efficiently.
